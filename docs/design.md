# M-HUB — design

Written: 2026-08-23
Status: approved, implemented
Translated from the Polish original: 2026-08-24

## 1. Purpose

One window on Windows for three messenger accounts: Messenger, a private WhatsApp and a
work WhatsApp. It replaces the paid All-in-One Messenger Hub, which — after the grace
period for existing users ended on 2026-07-18 — requires a Pro licence to run a second
WhatsApp account.

This project follows an audit of that application. The audit showed that the only feature
actually needed — several accounts of the same platform — comes down to isolated browser
profiles and requires no reverse engineering whatsoever. It also showed that the other app
loads `wppconnect-wa.js` (WPPConnect/wa-js v3.23.2), a library that reaches into the
internals of WhatsApp Web. That breaches WhatsApp's terms and risks a permanent ban on the
phone number. The operator's work number is one of the accounts in question, so avoiding
that entire category of tooling is an overriding requirement, not a preference.

**Widened 2026-08-25.** An account no longer has to be a messenger. See section 2,
*Whole services*: the mechanism the audit identified — an isolated browser profile in a
native view — turns out to be indifferent to what the profile holds, and the operator has
uses for two sites whose messaging is only one page among many. The purpose above still
describes what the application is *for*; it no longer describes the limit of what it may
hold.

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- three (eventually any number of) accounts in one window, each in an isolated session
- a configurable account list in a JSON file, plus an add-account screen in the app
- macros: saved fragments of text with WhatsApp formatting, and attachments
- dark theme, remembered window size and position
- a system tray icon and start-with-Windows
- system notifications and an unread count on the taskbar icon

### Out of scope

- locking the window with a PIN or Windows Hello (rejected by the operator)
- separate rules for the work account, a mute schedule (rejected)
- a notification bridge to `ntfy` (deferred; returns only if native notifications fail)
- any automatic sending of messages (forbidden — see section 7)
- contact export, chatbots, AI replies (the `wa-js` category, forbidden — see section 7)
- a web version and access from the work laptop (withdrawn by the operator, 2026-08-23)

### Whole services

*Amended 2026-08-25, by the operator's decision.*

An account may host a **whole service**, not only its messaging surface. LinkedIn and
Facebook enter the design as full sites — `linkedin.com`, `facebook.com` — rather than as
`/messaging/` and `/messages/`. Messaging on those two is one page inside a site the
operator reads anyway, and splitting it off would mean keeping the same login open twice.

This is a change of what the product *is*, not a longer list of URLs. A messenger is a
single screen the user watches; a social network is a place they navigate. Four
consequences follow, and none of them is optional:

1. **A navigation and child-window contract becomes a precondition, not a nicety.** A whole
   service is full of outbound links, and its sign-in legitimately crosses origins
   mid-flow. Without a policy the application is a browser with no address bar, no back
   button and notifications granted in advance — a worse place to click a stranger's link
   than the real browser next to it. Each platform therefore declares the hosts it owns
   and the hosts it authenticates through. Anything else opens in the system browser.
   Naive rules break this in both directions: blocking every off-origin navigation breaks
   OAuth, and allowing any host that merely *contains* the service name admits
   `facebook.com.example.invalid`.
2. **The unread badge stays honest and therefore stays absent.** `unreadFromTitle` reads a
   leading `(N)` from the page title, which is a convention of Meta's two messengers, not a
   general mechanism. Every other wrapper in this category reads the count by injecting a
   script that scrapes the page; section 7 forbids that, and the prohibition does not bend
   for a service the operator happens to want. A service whose title carries no count gets
   **no count**, and relies on the system notification instead. A badge that guesses is
   worse than a blank one.
3. **Notifications become a per-account matter.** A messenger notifies when a person writes
   to you. A social network notifies about reactions, groups, pages, birthdays and things
   it would like you to look at. Granting the permission once for every account, as the
   application does today, does not survive contact with a full Facebook.
4. **Platforms remain a closed list.** The obvious generalisation — an account type that
   takes any URL — is refused. It would turn a reviewed allowlist into an uncontrolled
   browser carrying live sessions, and it is a security regression wearing the costume of
   flexibility. Adding a service stays a deliberate edit to this design.

Section 7 is untouched by any of this. A whole service is still a page loaded exactly as
its owner serves it, with nothing injected into it.

## 3. Architecture

A single Electron application, run locally. No server, no containers, no dependency on any
existing infrastructure.

```
main window (BrowserWindow)
├── channel rail + macro panel          ← renderer, plain HTML/CSS
├── content area
│   ├── WebContentsView  session persist:acc-messenger  → messenger.com
│   ├── WebContentsView  session persist:acc-wa-priv    → web.whatsapp.com
│   ├── WebContentsView  session persist:acc-wa-work    → web.whatsapp.com

                                          sandboxed, and gone when its opener is
```

Each view costs about 250 MB once its page has loaded — measured 2026-08-25 at 754 MB for
one account, 1266 for three and 1760 for five, on a machine with 16 GB. Every account is
loaded at startup and stays loaded, deliberately: an account that is not loaded delivers no
notification and reports no count, which is the entire reason this application exists.
Whether five accounts are worth two gigabytes is the operator's decision, so the number is in
the README rather than hidden behind a lazy-loading switch.

Isolation comes from a separate session partition per account. The two WhatsApp accounts
see each other as two independent browsers — they share no cookies, no `localStorage` and
no `IndexedDB`. This is the heart of the application and the one mechanism without which
there is no product.

`WebContentsView` is Electron's current API for multiple views; `BrowserView` is deprecated
and the `webview` tag is discouraged by Electron itself. For content that needs its own
session, the documentation points directly at `WebContentsView` with a separate partition.

## 4. Components

Each component has one responsibility and can be tested on its own.

### 4.1 `accounts` — the account registry

Reads and writes the account list and assigns partition identifiers. Knows nothing about
windows.

### 4.2 `views` — the view manager

Creates a `WebContentsView` per account, attaches its session, sets the `User-Agent`,
governs geometry as the window resizes, and switches the active view. Knows nothing about
where the account list came from.

### 4.3 `macros` — the macro store

Holds macro definitions and copies of attachments, and searches by name and content. Knows
nothing about how a macro reaches a chat.

### 4.4 `insertion` — putting content in

Places text or a file on the clipboard and triggers a paste in the active view. The only
component that touches the clipboard. It does not send messages — ever (section 7).

Text goes through Electron's `clipboard.writeText`. A file needs the `CF_HDROP` format —
the one Windows sets on `Ctrl+C` in Explorer and the one Chromium hands to a page as
`DataTransfer.files`. Electron's `clipboard.writeBuffer('FileNameW', …)` handles only a
single file and gives no assurance that Chromium will interpret it that way, so we use the
method **verified empirically in stage 0**: calling
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -STA -Command "Set-Clipboard -LiteralPath …"`.

A catch found in stage 0: `Set-Clipboard -LiteralPath` and `Get-Clipboard -Format` exist
**only in Windows PowerShell 5.1**. PowerShell 7 has neither parameter, so the call must
name `powershell.exe` explicitly, never `pwsh`.

Cost: starting a process, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. If that turns out to be
noticeable, the alternative is a native module setting up a `DROPFILES` structure — a purely
performance decision, not a functional one, and taken only after measurement.

### 4.5 `shell` — the window shell

Window, tray, autostart, dark theme, remembered layout, notifications, badge.

## 5. Data model

Everything lives in the application data directory (`app.getPath('userData')`).

### 5.1 `accounts.json`

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "acc-wa-work",
      "name": "WhatsApp work",
      "platform": "whatsapp",
      "url": "https://web.whatsapp.com/",
      "color": "#2f7d5b"
    }
  ]
}
```

`id` is immutable — it serves as the partition name (`persist:acc-wa-work`). Changing `id`
means losing the session, so the interface does not allow editing it. `platform` selects the
default address and icon; `url` can be overridden by hand.

> Schema version 1 used Polish key names (`wersja`, `konta`, `nazwa`, `platforma`, `kolor`),
> because the app began as a private tool. Both spellings are accepted on read and version 2
> is written back on the next save, so upgrading costs nobody their accounts. See
> `tests/migration.test.js`.

### 5.2 `macros.json`

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "macros": [
    {
      "id": "mac-client-area",
      "name": "Guide — Client Area",
      "text": "*How to add a driver:*\n\n1. Sign in\n2. Open the Drivers tab\n\n> Get in touch if anything is unclear.",
      "attachments": ["att/4f2a-guide.pdf"],
      "tags": ["client-area", "guide"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `text` field stores **plain text with WhatsApp markers**, not rich text. WhatsApp
supports bold (asterisks), italics (underscores), strikethrough (tildes), a code block
(triple backticks), inline code (single backticks), a quote (greater-than at the start of a
line), a bulleted list (dash or asterisk plus a space) and a numbered one (digit, dot,
space). It has no underline. The markers behave identically on desktop and on the phone.

A consequence accepted deliberately: the markers are WhatsApp's. The same text pasted into
Messenger will show raw asterisks. Macros are aimed mainly at clients on WhatsApp, so
WhatsApp is the target format.

### 5.3 The attachment store

An attachment added to a macro is **copied** into the `att/` directory in the app data,
under a name prefixed with a UUID. This delivers the operator's requirement: files should
live in the application, so they need not be hunted down on disk each time. Deleting a macro
deletes the copies nothing else links to.

The interface shows the total size of the store. Single-file limit: 100 MB — safely below
WhatsApp's own limits and above a typical instructional video.

## 6. Flows

### 6.1 Application start

1. Read `accounts.json`; with no file, run the first-account wizard.
2. Create a view per account, with a `persist:<id>` session and an overridden `User-Agent`.
3. Restore the window size and position and the last active channel.
4. Inactive views load in the background so notifications work for every account.

### 6.2 Using a macro

1. The macro panel (`Ctrl+;`) with search across name and content.
2. Choosing a macro inserts the text into the message box of the active chat.
3. If the macro has an attachment, it goes in as a separate step, after the text.
4. **The application stops there.** The operator sends the message by pressing Enter.

### 6.3 Adding an account

An "Add account" screen: name, platform from a list, optionally a custom address and channel
colour. Saved to `accounts.json`, a view created, and sign-in by QR code or the platform's
own form — exactly as in a browser.

## 7. Security boundaries

Three rules the design does not cross. They follow directly from the audit of 2026-08-23.

**7.1 The application does not send messages.** A macro prepares the content and stops.
Preparing a message is user behaviour; sending it automatically would be the automation the
audit warned about. The boundary is here, not further out.

**7.2 The application does not load `wa-js`, WPPConnect, Baileys or any related library.**
No access to the internals of any page an account loads. Pages load exactly as their owner
serves them.

**7.3 Content is inserted through the clipboard.** A clipboard write and a paste are
indistinguishable from doing it by hand. Stage 0 settled this rule positively and **without
exceptions** — see section 9. The application does not manipulate elements of a loaded page
for any purpose, attachments included.

Beyond these rules the application is an ordinary browser with tabs.

> **Generalised 2026-08-25, alongside the *Whole services* amendment in section 2.** Rules
> 7.2 and 7.3 were written naming WhatsApp, because at the time WhatsApp was the only page
> whose internals anyone would have been tempted to reach into. Now that an account may
> host any service on the list, a prohibition that names one site would have left the
> others outside it — which is the opposite of what these rules are for. The wording is
> widened to every page an account loads; nothing is relaxed, and the reason is unchanged.
> The temptation the rules exist to refuse is the same one in every case: reading a page's
> DOM to obtain an unread count. Section 2 states the consequence plainly — a service whose
> title carries no count gets no count.

## 8. Error handling

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `accounts.json` damaged | a backup copy alongside it, start with an empty list, message shown |
| no network | the view shows the platform's own state; the app does not intervene |
| WhatsApp refuses the client (`User-Agent`) | an explicit message suggesting an update |
| attachment file missing from the store | the macro is marked incomplete, the text still works |
| file over the limit | refused, with the size and the limit reported |
| session signed out | the view shows a QR code; the app does not intervene |

## 9. Stages

**Stage 0 — settling the clipboard question. DONE 2026-08-23, result POSITIVE.**

The question: does WhatsApp Web accept a file pasted from the Windows clipboard (`CF_HDROP`)?

How it went. The first layer was checked by reading the artefact, not by the absence of an
error: `Set-Clipboard -LiteralPath` in Windows PowerShell 5.1, then `Get-Clipboard -Format
FileDropList` confirmed one file on the clipboard with the text layer empty. The second layer
was checked by hand by the operator, in Edge on `web.whatsapp.com`, in a chat with himself,
outside the audited application (that one loads `wa-js` and would have given a false positive).

Material: a 10.23 MB instructional video (signature `ftypmp42`) and a 0.74 MB PDF — real
files of the same class as future macro content. Sizes were chosen below WhatsApp's limits so
that a refusal could not be blamed on file size.

Result: **both types pasted correctly.** The video showed a player with a caption field, the
document a file card. A visible thumbnail strip with a button to add another attachment
confirms that several files can be inserted one after another.

Consequences: substituting a file into the page's form field is **not needed and does not
enter the design**. Rule 7.3 applies without exception. Stage 3 builds the clipboard path only.

**Stage 1 — the core.** `accounts`, `views`, `shell`. Three accounts, isolation, channels,
`User-Agent`, dark theme, window layout, tray, autostart, notifications.

**Stage 2 — text macros.** `macros`, `insertion`, the panel with search, the editor with a
formatting bar and a preview, the `Ctrl+;` shortcut.

**Stage 3 — attachments.** The `att/` store, insertion per the result of stage 0.

**Stage 4 — distribution.** `electron-builder`, a single installer, autostart.

**Stage 5 — staying alive. DONE 2026-08-25.**

The app is asked to sit in the tray all day and notice things. Everything here serves that,
and each item below was measured before it was changed rather than assumed.

- **The rail no longer closes under the operator's own cursor** when another window takes the
  foreground. Chromium reports that as a mouseleave carrying the position the pointer had all
  along; `acceptHoverReport` in `shell.js` weighs the report, and returning to the foreground
  asks the renderer where the pointer is now, because holding a report back loses it.
- **Accounts in the background run at full speed.** `backgroundThrottling` was unset, so a
  100 ms timer ticked 10 times in ten seconds in a hidden view instead of 100 — and hiding the
  window to the tray put the ACTIVE account in that state too.
- **A second copy over the same profile gives up** instead of fighting the first over the
  cookie stores, where the loser loses its sign-in.
- **The window button puts the app in the tray**, on by default, switchable in Settings.
  Autostart passes `--hidden` on the command line and the window is built unshown;
  `openAsHidden` is macOS-only and did nothing here.
- **Ctrl+1..9 selects a channel by position** and **Ctrl+Shift+Space** raises the window and
  opens the macro palette from anywhere. A refused global shortcut is reported rather than
  left silent.
- **Clicking a notification lands on the account it came from.** A view taking focus asks the
  renderer to switch — but not until its first load has settled, because a view takes focus
  while it is being created and the app would otherwise start on whichever account happened
  to finish last.
- **A stale or dead account can be reloaded** without restarting the others: Ctrl+R, and a
  button in the status bar offered after a crash, a hang, a failed load or waking from sleep.
  Nothing reloads on its own, because reloading throws away a half-typed message.
- **A local log** in `%APPDATA%\M-HUB\logs\`, reachable from the tray. It writes only the
  fields on a declared list and drops everything else, so it can be sent to somebody. Page
  titles are excluded precisely because they carry contact names.
- **The clipboard session survives a bad day**: stderr is drained, a timed-out process is put
  down rather than reused, and a clipboard that refuses a file is reported instead of
  escaping the handler.

**Stage 5.6 — the navigation contract** is called out separately because stage 7 depends on
it. Every address now has a declared place to open: the account view, a controlled child
window, the system browser, or nowhere. The decision rests on host lists a platform declares,
never on how a window was asked for — a sign-in popup and a link to an article cannot be told
apart by disposition or features. Host matching is a suffix comparison on a dot boundary, the
external list is consulted first because link shims live on the service's own domain, and only
`http:` and `https:` are ever handed to the system.

**Stage 6 — macros 2.0. DONE 2026-08-25**, except 6.5, which needs the operator's consent
because it would change the LETTER of rule 7.3, and 6.7, which waits for stage 7.

- **Tags stop being a field only the file format knew about.** The model has carried them
  since stage 2 and the search box says "name, content or tag", but no screen ever set one.
  The editor now has a field, the palette shows them, and clicking one searches for it. Case
  is settled on the way in, because search settles it on the way out.
- **Placeholders.** Any `{name}` in a macro becomes a question asked BEFORE anything is
  written anywhere — cancelling leaves the clipboard untouched. `{date}` and `{data}` fill
  themselves. A macro without placeholders passes through unchanged.
- **The status bar stopped claiming an insertion it cannot see.** Measured: with no editable
  field focused, `webContents.paste()` does nothing and reports nothing, while the message
  said "Inserted". Finding out for certain would mean reading the page, which rule 7.3
  forbids, so the sentence says what is known and asks the operator to check the box.

One thing the plan expected to build turned out to be there already and is now pinned by a
test rather than rebuilt: the palette header has named the destination account since stage 2.

The other, the keyboard returning to the account after an insertion, was first written up as
already working and that was **wrong** — measured in a state nobody is ever in, with the app's
window not in front. A window that is not in front has no keyboard to hand anybody. Measured
properly it returns in one of the two states and not the other, depending on which
`webContents` held focus when the palette opened, so the application now asks for it instead
of relying on what closing a `<dialog>` happens to do.

**Stage 7 — whole services. DONE 2026-08-25**, except Telegram, which stays out.

LinkedIn and Facebook can be added like any other account, and stand entirely on the
navigation contract from 5.6: a full service is a few hundred outgoing links, each of which
would otherwise open a bare window carrying the account's signed-in session.

- **LinkedIn is entered at `/feed/` on the www host**, never at the apex — measured twice
  with curl, the apex answers "Checking your browser - reCAPTCHA". Its sign-in hosts are
  declared, because they genuinely leave the service: Apple's opens a window and answers
  through `postMessage` to its opener, so it can neither go to the system browser nor be
  denied.
- **Neither service shows a count.** `unreadFromTitle` now reads "(99+)" correctly — it used
  to return zero, so the badge vanished exactly when an account was busiest — but LinkedIn's
  number is the sum of eight badge sources, and Facebook's 2026 format could not be confirmed
  at all. Both are one word from being turned on and the reason sits on the entry.
- **Notifications are controlled per account**, which was the condition for shipping
  Facebook. Messengers may interrupt out of the box, whole services stay quiet until asked,
  and the account overrides its platform in either direction.

**A one-way door.** An `accounts.json` holding a `linkedin` or `facebook` account, opened by
a build that predates them, is silently dropped by the validation filter in `loadAccounts` —
and the next save writes the shortened list. Going back a version deletes those accounts and
their sign-ins. This is in both READMEs and belongs in the release notes.

**Telegram is not here.** It works, its session stands on its own, and its client is GPLv3 —
but its title says "3 notifications" only while the tab is idle, blinking once a second, and
one of the two clients reports a delta rather than a total. It was optional in the plan, it
needs an account to verify, and a closed platform list is only worth anything while every
entry on it has been seen working.

**Stage 8 — four things the operator found in a day of use. DONE 2026-08-25.**

**0.3.0 had no release because it had no tag.** The workflow publishes on `refs/tags/` and
nothing else, and the version in `package.json` was raised without one being pushed. Not a
failure of the pipeline — a step nobody took. A release now also says what the version changes:
the body is the section for that tag cut out of `docs/release-notes.md`, followed by the
installation caveats, and a tag with no section fails the step instead of publishing an empty
body.

**A pinned button takes its icon from the shortcut, never from the running window.** Measured
2026-08-25: the pinned `Electron.lnk` targeted `node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe` with
`IconLocation ",0"` — the atom, straight out of the target — and the `msg-hub.lnk` already in
the Start menu pointed at `build\ikona.ico`, a file gone since the repository was anglicised.
Installing the packaged build is the usual answer and is not available on a machine with Smart
App Control, where running from source is the supported path. So `npm run shortcut` writes the
shortcut instead, with the icon and — through the shell property store, because `WScript.Shell`
has no idea it exists — the same AppUserModelID the application sets at startup. Without the
identity the live window will not merge into the pinned button, and the taskbar carries two.

**The icon carries nine frames.** It had one, 256 square, and Windows draws it at 16, 24 or 32
everywhere that matters. `build/ico.mjs` assembles the `.ico` from the PNG set in
`src/renderer/icons`, which is the one place the artwork lives; `build/icon.ico` is generated
from the same bytes for electron-builder, and a test fails if the two drift apart. The set is
under `src/` because `package.json` packs `src/**/*` and nothing else — an icon in `build/`
reaches the installer and never reaches the installed application.

**The badge stopped following the page's blink.** A page with something waiting alternates its
own title — "(1) Messenger", "Messenger", about once a second — and the count read that
literally, so the overlay appeared for a second and vanished for the next. Nothing in the path
from a title to the badge has a clock, which left the page as the only candidate; the same
behaviour is recorded above as one of the reasons Telegram is out. The latch in
`src/main/unread.js` is one-sided: a count going UP is shown at once, a zero is believed only
after three seconds of zeros. Measured after: 40 of 40 samples over ten seconds kept the count
while the page blinked every 0.9 s, and a page that genuinely went quiet cleared it in 2583 ms.
The timer in `refreshBadge` is the part that is easy to omit — a page that stops blinking stops
sending titles, so a held zero has nothing coming to release it.

**A download says how it ended.** The handling was one line announcing the start, and nothing
ever asked the item how it went, so "Downloading …" stayed on the bar with the file already on
the disk. It now ends: saved, with a button to the folder it landed in; or cancelled or
interrupted, with which. A success takes itself away after eight seconds, a failure does not.
The identity carried by a message is what makes that safe — a timer hides only the message it
put there, never the crash report that took the bar over in the meantime. Settings gained the
folder and the "ask every time" switch, which starts ON because asking is what Electron already
does when no path is set. Turning it off means the application sets the path, and from that
moment Chromium stops numbering repeated names — hence `uniquePath`, or the same attachment
downloaded twice would land on top of itself. "Show in folder" is given the id of a download
this process recorded, never a path: `showItemInFolder` with an argument a page could choose
would point Explorer at anything on the disk.

**What Explorer does with a folder it is handed.** "Show in folder" was asked to open a tab in
an Explorer window that is already up, and a new window only when none is in front. That
decision belongs to the shell, not to this application: `shell.showItemInFolder` calls
`SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems`, and what happens next is Explorer's business. So it was measured
rather than assumed — Windows 11 build 26200, one call per state, counting top-level
`CabinetWClass` windows and the `Shell.Application` entries beside them:

| Before the call | After |
|---|---|
| an Explorer window open, not in front, showing another folder | a NEW window, 1 → 2 |
| an Explorer window in front, showing another folder | a NEW window, 2 → 3 |
| a window already showing the target folder | that window, brought forward. 3 → 3 |
| no Explorer window at all | not measured — it would have meant closing the operator's own |

So the tab never happens: this build opens a window whether or not Explorer is in front, and no
setting for it exists under `Explorer\Advanced` (`OpenFoldersInNewTab` and `TabsEnabled` are
both absent, `SeparateProcess` is 0). What the operator asked to avoid, though, does not happen
either — **windows do not pile up**, because a folder already open is reused and brought
forward, which is the case that repeats when files keep landing in one download folder.

**Forcing the tab anyway: measured, then refused.** The operator asked to see the cost before
deciding, so a prototype was built and run rather than estimated. Three routes exist and two of
them do not do what their names suggest:

| Route | What it actually did |
|---|---|
| the `opennewtab` verb — it really is registered under `HKCR\Folder\shell` | invoked from outside Explorer it **returns success and does nothing**. The key carries `OnlyInBrowserWindow` and a `DelegateExecute` handler, and `Shell.Application` does not even list the verb among a folder's own |
| `IShellWindows` → `Navigate2` | **no tab**: it replaces the contents of the window the operator was looking at. Measured, one window went from folder A to folder B, count unchanged |
| driving Explorer's keyboard — `Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+L`, the path, Enter | **works**: windows 2 → 2, tabs 3 → 4, on the right folder, with a name containing brackets surviving the escaping |

So a tab is reachable only by typing into somebody else's window, and it costs more than the
window it saves. The prototype came to 99 lines, 37 of them P/Invoke, plus roughly 50 more to
wire in with a fallback and a switch — but the line count is the least of it:

- **the file stops being selected.** `showItemInFolder` selects it; the tab route has to reach
  it by type-ahead in the file list, and the measurement selected TWO items instead of one.
- **it types on the operator's keyboard.** Guarded — the script sends nothing unless the window
  it raised really reached the foreground — but that is the nature of the thing, not a detail.
- **it cannot be covered by the gate.** Playwright cannot see Explorer, and a CI runner has no
  Explorer window at all, so on CI only the fallback would ever run. Everything else here is
  tested.

Refused on 2026-08-25 with those numbers in hand. `showItemInFolder` stays.

**Stage 9 — the name. DONE 2026-08-26.**

The application is called M-HUB. What that costs is not obvious from the field being changed,
so it was measured first, on a throwaway Electron app rather than on this one: with only
`name` in package.json, `app.getName()` returns it and the profile sits in `%APPDATA%\<name>`;
add `productName` and the name, the profile directory AND the token Electron writes into the
default User-Agent all follow it. One field, three consequences.

| | before | after | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| window, tray, shortcut, installer | msg-hub | **M-HUB** | the point of the exercise |
| profile directory | `%APPDATA%\msg-hub` | `%APPDATA%\M-HUB` | follows `productName`; **not migrated** — see below |
| User-Agent token | `msg-hub/0.4.0` | removed | it was removed before too, by a literal |
| `appId` | `pl.kencki.msghub` | unchanged | NSIS derives the installation's GUID from it |
| repository | `mkencki/msg-hub` | unchanged | every published release links through it |

**No migration, by the operator's decision.** The profile moves with the name, and the 805 MB
left behind — three signed-in sessions, one macro, its 4.7 MB attachment — were deleted
outright before the release rather than carried across. A migration was designed and costed
(a guarded move, a fallback to the old directory, and a guard against `--user-data-dir`, which
would otherwise have dragged a real profile into a test's temporary directory) and then not
built, because the operator preferred to configure a clean installation. There is therefore no
half-migrated state anywhere in the code to reason about later.

**The literal in cleanUserAgent was the sharp edge.** Electron builds the User-Agent out of
the application's name, and the function that took it back out matched `/msg-hub\//`. After a
rename that pattern matches nothing, and the failure is silent: the new name simply starts
going out to Meta's servers. The end-to-end test guarding it — `not.toMatch(/msg-hub/i)` —
would have stayed green, because it named the old string too. Both now ask the running
application what it is called. Proved by mutation on 2026-08-26: with the literal restored,
the test failed with `m-hub/0.4.0 chrome/150...` in the received User-Agent.

**The installer stopped wearing NSIS's blue wizard.** electron-builder passes
`build/installerSidebar.bmp` to `MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP` and falls back to
`nsis3-metro.bmp` when it is missing, which is what the finish page showed until now. The two
bitmaps — 164x314 beside the welcome and finish pages, 150x57 on the header of the rest — are
drawn from the same four rounded rectangles as the icon, by a rasteriser in `build/mark.mjs`,
so the mark has one source. A .bmp stores its rows bottom-up and pads each one to four bytes;
neither mistake fails a build, both produce a garbled wizard, and `tests/bmp.test.js` reads
them back out of the bytes. The header bitmap is white because MUI paints that bar white.

## 10. Tests

Behaviour is tested, not implementation detail.

- **session isolation** — proof that a cookie written in one account's partition is invisible
  in another's. The heart of the product, so covered by a test rather than by inspection.
- `accounts` — read, write, damaged file, missing file, refusal to change `id`
- `macros` — adding, searching, deleting along with attachment copies, the size limit
- `insertion` — content reaches the clipboard in the expected shape; **a negative test: no
  path invokes sending a message** (enforcement of rule 7.1)
- `shell` — the window layout survives a restart

## 11. Risks

| Risk | Weight | Response |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp refuses the client over `User-Agent` | high | override the UA from the first launch; stage 1 |
| Electron's Chromium too old for WhatsApp | medium | keep the version fresh; the fix is a version bump |
| Delay inserting a file (`powershell.exe` startup) | low | measured in stage 3; noticeable above ~500 ms, beyond that a native module |
| The attachment store growing without bound | low | per-file limit, a usage counter, copies deleted with the macro |

The risk "the clipboard does not accept files" was **closed** in stage 0 (2026-08-23). With
it went the risk of being sensitive to Meta rebuilding the page — the mechanism of
substituting a file into a form does not enter the design.

## 12. Rejected alternatives

Recorded for the record. The road to this design was long, and these dead ends are documented
so that nobody walks back into them.

**A web version as a page with tabs.** Not feasible. `web.whatsapp.com` sends
`frame-ancestors https://*.whatsapp.com https://whatsapp.com`, and `www.messenger.com` sends
`frame-ancestors 'self'`. Embedding either in a frame on a foreign domain is blocked by the
browser. Working around it with a rewriting proxy was rejected: WhatsApp Web rests on
WebSockets, service workers and Web Crypto, and that kind of manipulation would be
indistinguishable from an attack.

**A hub on a server, streamed with Neko (WebRTC).** Rejected after looking at the topology:
WebRTC media travels over UDP, while the operator's ingress is a Cloudflare Tunnel on a CGNAT
link. It would require a TURN server or open UDP ports — the first adds a dependency billed
by traffic, the second is impossible.

**A hub on a server, streamed with KasmVNC.** Technically feasible (WebSockets pass through
the tunnel) and designed all the way to the deployment stage, then withdrawn on 2026-08-23
along with the decision to drop access from the work laptop. It would have cost WSL2 and
Docker Engine on a node — the first container in that infrastructure and a permanent widening
of the maintenance surface.

**Cloudflare browser-based RDP.** A workable fallback should remote access ever return as a
requirement: available on all plans, reuses the existing `cloudflared` and CF Access, and
leaves the RDP port on loopback. Dropped for the same reason as above.

**C# WPF with WebView2, and Tauri 2.** A lighter result (roughly 15 MB and 10 MB against
roughly 200 MB), but the first needs the .NET SDK installed and pulls in a stack outside the
operator's toolkit, while the second needs a Rust toolchain and rests on a young API across
several webviews.

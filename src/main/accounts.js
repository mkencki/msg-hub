// goes through, and they are separate because trusting them is a different decision from
// trusting the service. `external` is consulted BEFORE `hosts` and exists only for entries
// that would otherwise match one: the shims Meta wraps outgoing links in live on the
// service's own domain, so without it every link out would stay inside the account view.

// An entry that changes no outcome does not belong here. It would teach the next reader
// that the list was guessed at rather than measured.

// channel is read as. A whole service's number is something else wearing the same clothes,
// and putting the two in one rail makes both of them lie a little. Turning one on is one
// word; the reasons are on each entry.
